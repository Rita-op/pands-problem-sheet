## FILE: collatz.py


Solution to week 04

 This file contains the solution to weekly task 04. In this task, we were told to write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer number and outputs the successive values of a required calculation. For the case that concerns us, at each step we have to calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. The program has to end if the current value is one.
