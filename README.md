## FILE : bmi.py 


The solution to week 02

This file contains the solution to weekly task 02. In this task, we were told to calculate someone's Body Mass Index (BMI).

The solution to week 03

This file contains the solution to weekly task 03. In this task, we needed to write a program that asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order.

## FILE: collatz.py


The solution to week 04

 This file contains the solution to weekly task 04. In this task, we were told to write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer number and outputs the successive values of a required calculation. For the case that concerns us, at each step we have to calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. The program has to end if the current value is one.

## FILE: weekday.py


The solution to week 05

This file contains the solution to weekly task 05. In this task, we needed to write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday.

## FILE: squareroot.py


The solution to week 06

This file contains the solution to weekly task 06. In this task, we needed to write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root. In order to do that, we could not use any built-in function but we had to create our own function.

As we were advised, I used Newton's Method for estimating square roots to develop my solution. The equation used in the solution, since we needed to calculate the square root of a number, was the following: 

             x1 = 0.5 *(x0 + (n/x0))

The solution to week 07


This file contains the solution to weekly task 07. In this task, we were told to write a program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains. I would like to point out that I assumed that we are asked to count all the eâ€™s regardless of whether they are in uppercase or lowercase. For that reason, my solution to this weekly task counts all the e's a given document contains (uppercase and lowercase).

Lastly, I let you know that I have included a text file called "moby-dick.txt" that you can use to test the code.

The solution to week 08

This file contains the solution to weekly task 08. In this task, we were told to write a program that displays a plot of the functions f(x)=x, g(x)=x^2 and h(x)=x^3 in the range [0, 4] on the one set of axes.
